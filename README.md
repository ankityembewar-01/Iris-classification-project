# Iris-classification-project

This is very beginner project for the Data Science aspirant.In this project, we get information from dataset after prepocessing it. Now what will be the next? 
So I made one GUI application using Tkinter to classify the Iris flower according to dataset. It get input as sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width to predict the output as species of Iris flower.
